In the last few months at my job, a collogue of mine, who is a git-wizard, has helped me better understand git.
This collogue (An Emacs user) is always trying to get me to switch to SpaceMacs, and while I see the benefits and have even tried using it before, I just can't get it to stick.
Of all the nice features I'm missing out on ([Evil mode][1], [Org mode][2], [Helm][3]), the biggest one is [Magit][4]. 

Magit is a wrapper around Git that provides a blazing fast interface and sane
default commands. I won't get that deep into its benefits, but just wanted to
shout out my coworker, and his inarguably superior git workflow ðŸ˜‰.

- `git pull --rebase`
- `git commit --amend`
- `push --force-with-lease`
- `git reset --soft HEAD~n`
- `git stash show -p stash@{0}`
